## Learning Objectives

In this lesson, we will discuss:

- Who you are, and why you signed up for this course
- Why you should learn to code
- Why Python is great!

## Who are you?

As we begin, and ensure that everyone has a working MATLAB installation, feel free to write in the Teams chat which Department you are from, and any reasons you signed up for this course!  

## Why learn to code?

Loads of reasons! Focused on researchers specifically:

- Code allows you to analyse large (millions of rows) data sets.
- Scripts, programs and software are explicit lists of instructions. Hence, analysis performed via code makes this analysis more reproducible, replicable, and robust.
- Code allows you to share your analysis with others. It becomes easier to integrate into other systems built with code, such as websites, blogs, dashboards, and other pieces of software.
- Code can help create complex visualisations, nicely formatted documents, animations, and other engaging outputs.
- Code can speed up repetitive tasks such as editing or renaming files, copying data, and even collecting new data.
- Code can help manage multi-user projects, ensuring research is not lost when individuals move on.
- Being fluent in even one coding language can open up many career opportunities.

But most importantly:

- It is fun, and also incredibly satisfying, to build things!

## Why MATLAB?
- MATLAB is commonly used in engineering and academic settings.
- Matrix maniupulation in MATLAB is well considered, so if using matrices is significant part of your research, MATLAB is an obvious choice.
- Present data and plots professionally for publications, presentations and thesis.
- The learning curve to code and understanding syntax is less steep than other popular languages (perfect for beginners and dabbling)
- Graphical user interface (GUI) is attractive and easy to use.  
- Simulink is an effective toolbox with many powerful, in-built functions, extending usage for more complex applications. 

## Why NOT MATLAB?

MATLAB is not open-source, and toolboxes are incredibly expensive. If you plan on ever leaving academia and programming for yourself, or for your own company, you should not learn MATLAB (as you will have to pay huge amounts to avoid wasting your language-specific knowledge). In addition, outside of engineering, MATLAB is less commonly used.
