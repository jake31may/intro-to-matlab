# The Challenge
Fitbit is a wearable device which tracks and stores data of the user. Data has been collected over 5 years, between 2016-2020. Each year has been split into a separate csv file, although the year is unknown:

|Year label| File link  |
|--------|------------|
|A       |![yearA](../downloads/yearA.csv)|
|--------|-------------|

The primary challenge is to determine which year is 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. What other information can you deduce from the data? It may be   possible for example to predict an age range, but justify your reasons. 

You are encouraged to work in groups and communicate with each other.
